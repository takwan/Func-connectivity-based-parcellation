# Project
Unbalanced fronto-pallidal neurocircuit underlying set shifting in OCD [Kim, T et al., 2022, *Brain*](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awab483).
- Functional connectivity-based parcellation of striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus
- Exploiting unsupervised clustering method, we parceled the globus pallidus into external and internal subregions, which are key regions for the direct and indirect pathways in the cortico-striatal circuitry.


# Atlas created using resting-state fMRI
- the atlas images are available upon request to the Lead Contact (Prof. Jun Soo Kwon).
- data from 105 patients with OCD and 99 healthy volunteers.
- data acquisition from Dept of Psychiatry at Seoul National University Hospital (PI: Prof. Jun Soo Kwon).
